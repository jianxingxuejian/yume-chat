_yume is the romanization of the Japanese word "夢" (dream)._
_Always remember that AI does not possess intelligence — it merely speaks in dreams._

This is an experimental project. Most features are under active development and may change or be removed at any time.

**yume-chat** is an experimental, multi-platform chat application built with **Node.js (backend)** and **Vue (frontend)**.

It is currently under active development. Features may change or be removed at any time.
It is designed to support multiple platforms, including Web, Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

### Why choose yume-chat?

Despite the abundance of AI chat clients, yume-chat was born from a need for something more personal and flexible. Here’s how it differs:

- **[NextChat](https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/NextChat)**  
  A mature client, but lacks critical features like multi-account sync, conversation sharing, and custom knowledge bases.

- **[one-api](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api) / [new-api](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api)**  
  Great for request forwarding, but limited in functionality. yume-chat aims to **extend beyond simple proxying**, offering integrated chat features.

- **[coai](https://github.com/coaidev/coai)**  
  While innovative in design, its complex architecture makes secondary development difficult.  
  yume-chat strives to be **lightweight and developer-friendly**.
